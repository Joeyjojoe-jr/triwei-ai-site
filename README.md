# TriWei AI Blog

This repository contains the scaffolding for a simple blog that
automatically publishes weekly articles about developments in the field of
artificial intelligence.  The blog is built entirely from static HTML
generated by Python scripts, and it is designed to be hosted on
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) without requiring any paid
hosting plan.

## How it works

1. **Posts are stored as Markdown files** in the `posts/` directory.  Each file
   begins with a YAML front matter block containing metadata such as the
   title, date and author.
2. A weekly GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/weekly-blog.yml`)
   runs every Monday at 09:00 UTC (adjust the cron schedule in the
   workflow if you prefer a different time).  The workflow:
   - Executes `scripts/generate_post.py`, which picks a topic from a
     list and writes a new Markdown post with front matter.
   - Runs `scripts/build_site.py` to convert all Markdown posts into
     HTML pages under the `docs/` directory.  The script generates an
     index page listing all posts and individual pages for each post.
   - Commits any changes and pushes them back to the repository.
3. GitHub Pages serves the contents of the `docs/` directory as your
   website.  After enabling Pages in the repository settings, set the
   build source to the `docs/` folder on the `main` branch.

## Customising the blog

- **Topics**: Edit the `TOPICS` list in `scripts/generate_post.py` to
  define the themes you want the blog to cover.  To integrate a real
  research pipeline, replace the placeholder body text with calls to
  your preferred API or language model.
- **Content templates**: Modify `scripts/build_site.py` to change the
  HTML templates or styling.  The included stylesheet (`docs/style.css`)
  provides a minimal layout that you can extend as needed.
- **Schedule**: Adjust the cron expression in
  `.github/workflows/weekly-blog.yml` to change how often new posts are
  generated and published.

- **Logo**: To include your logo as a background, add a file named
  `logo.png` to the root of the repository.  When the build script
  runs, it will automatically copy `logo.png` into the `docs/`
  directory and apply it as a fullâ€‘page background.  If no `logo.png`
  file is present, the site will fall back to a plain background.

## Manual builds

You can run the generator and build locally if you have Python 3 and
`pyyaml` installed:

```bash
python scripts/generate_post.py  # create a new post
python scripts/build_site.py     # rebuild the site
```

The generated site will appear in the `docs/` directory.  Commit and
push the changes to make them live on GitHub Pages.
