Small prompt edits can create large behavior changes, so I now debug prompts with a fixed checklist.

## Checklist

1. Keep task, constraints, and output format in separate sections.
2. Add one concrete input and expected output example.
3. Remove ambiguous words like "good" or "best" and replace with measurable criteria.

## Result

Response consistency improved when output format and success criteria were explicitly stated.
