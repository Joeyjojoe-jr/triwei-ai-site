title: "Embeddings"
description: Vector representations used for semantic search and retrieval.
---
Embeddings map text, images, or other data into vectors so semantic similarity can be measured numerically.

## Practical Uses

- Retrieval-augmented generation
- Semantic search
- Clustering and recommendation

## Design Considerations

- Dimensionality impacts storage and retrieval speed.
- Embedding model choice should match your content domain.
- Re-embedding strategy is needed when source data changes.
