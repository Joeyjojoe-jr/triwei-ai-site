We are rebuilding TriWei AI as a fast, lightweight place to share short posts and experiments. Expect quick notes on tools, small explainers, and the occasional game or interactive demo.

## What is changing

- A simpler publishing flow: add a Markdown file and it is live on GitHub Pages.
- A refreshed retro theme with better readability and contrast.
- A new games section starting with Orbit Runner.

## What is next

- Short weekly posts.
- More mini-games and playful experiments.
- A lightweight update log so you always know what is new.
