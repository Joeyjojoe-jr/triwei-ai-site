TriWei AI is a personal Explorer Hub for studying AI systems through focused reading, practical experiments, and reusable guides.

## How to use this hub

1. Start with the Knowledge Map from `_knowledge/` for core concepts.
2. Follow Guides from `_guides/` for repeatable setup and workflows.
3. Review experiments in `_experiments/` for implementation notes.
4. Capture reflections in `_blog/` as your understanding evolves.

## Update rhythm

- Add one knowledge page whenever you finish a concept.
- Add one experiment note after each hands-on session.
- Add short blog notes to summarize what changed in your thinking.
