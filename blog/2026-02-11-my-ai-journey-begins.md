<!-- Add new notes in /blog/ with date + title front matter. -->
Today marks the start of a more structured AI learning process. Instead of collecting random bookmarks, this hub organizes concepts, experiments, and reflections in one place.

## What I Am Optimizing For

- Consistent progress over occasional intensity
- Practical understanding over passive reading
- Reusable workflows over one-off hacks

## First Commitments

1. Keep a living knowledge map for core concepts.
2. Run at least one focused experiment every week.
3. Write a short summary note after each learning sprint.

## Next Milestone

Publish three follow-up notes: one on transformers, one on embeddings, and one on inference tradeoffs.
