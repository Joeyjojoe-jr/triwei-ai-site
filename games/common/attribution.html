  <h2>Collaboration Credits</h2>
  <p>
    These interactive labs are the result of a close collaboration between a human author and an AI assistant (ChatGPT).  The
    AI contributed algorithmic refinements, numerical safeguards and visual improvements, while the human designed the
    pedagogical structure, reviewed all code, and ensured educational accuracy.  Mathematical formulas and derivations
    are referenced to reputable course notes and textbooks.  All code runs entirely in the browser; no data is sent to any
    server.
