<!-- Expand this page with deployment-specific notes when needed. -->
Inference is the runtime phase where a trained model produces outputs for real user requests.

## Main Priorities

- Latency
- Throughput
- Reliability
- Cost efficiency

## Common Levers

- Quantization
- Caching
- Batching
- Hardware selection

## Why It Matters

A strong model is only useful when inference is stable, fast, and affordable in production.
